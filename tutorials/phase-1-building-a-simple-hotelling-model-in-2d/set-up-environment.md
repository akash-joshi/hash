# Environment Setup

After opening up a new simulation in HASH, navigate to globals.json. First, we are going to set up the [**Topology**](https://docs.hash.ai/core/configuration/topology), or the environment, of the model.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="globals.json" %}
```javascript
{
  "topology": {
    "x_bounds": [
      0,
      10
    ],
    "y_bounds": [
      0,
      10
    ],
    "search_radius": 15
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Setting the x\_bounds and y\_bounds creates a 10x10 boundary within the environment which will be used to generate the customer and business agents. This code also sets the search\_radius of all agents in the simulation to 15, which will automatically update an agentâ€™s neighbor list to include all agents within a distance of 15.
